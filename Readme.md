# RF Analyzer for Android

**RF Analyzer** is an Android app for real-time spectrum analysis using SDR
hardware such as HackRF and RTL-SDR. It displays live **FFT and waterfall
plots** of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum and supports **demodulation**,
**recording**, and more.

Whether you're a radio hobbyist, ham operator, or just curious about what's
flying through the airwaves, RF Analyzer makes exploring the RF world from your
phone both practical and fun.

## Download & Support

Get RF Analyzer on **Google Play**:

[![Get it on Google Play](./docs/assets/google_play_badge.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer)

The app is available as a **free trial**, giving you 7 days of usage after
installation and up to 60 minutes of operation time. This allows you to fully
explore the features and see if it fits your needs and works with your
hardware.

If you enjoy using the app, you can unlock the full version via a **one-time
in-app purchase**.

RF Analyzer is a passion project developed in my spare time. A lot of
effort has gone into making it useful, reliable, and fun to use. Supporting
the app through the in-app purchase not only removes the trial limitations -
it also helps me keep improving and maintaining the project. Thank you! üôè
