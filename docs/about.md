## About the author

Hi! Iâ€™m DM4NTZ, a ham radio operator and open-source developer.

I'm the creator and maintainer of RF Analyzer, an open-source software-defined
radio (SDR) app for Android. The app lets you visualize and analyze RF signals
in real time using SDR hardware such as RTL-SDR dongles.

My goal is to make SDR technology more accessible, portable, and open for radio
enthusiasts, experimenters, and learners.

As a licensed amateur radio operator, I'm passionate about signal processing,
wireless communication, and the broader SDR ecosystem. I also contribute to
open-source projects, share knowledge with the ham radio community, and
continuously improve my tools based on user feedback.

If you like what I'm building or want to support the development of RF Analyzer
and related open-source SDR tools, you can support me with one of the following
options. Every contribution helps keep the project alive and open for everyone.
